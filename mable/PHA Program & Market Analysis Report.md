### 

### **Deliverables**

* A detailed report including:  
  * Screenshots or embedded graphs of the empirical CDF curves.  
  * The condensed dataset (in a table or CSV format).  
  * Calculated outputs (medians, costs, prices, and TAM).  
* Excel sheets, Python/R scripts or code snippets used for analysis, with explanations of how each step was implemented.

### **Introduction to Dataset**

### **Assignment**

* Part 1: Program Size Analysis  
* Part 2: Market Size Analysis

#### **Medians**

* The median number of **HCV units** across all housing authorities is **77**  
* The median number of **non-HCV public housing units** across all housing authorities is **50**  
* The median number of **total public housing units** across all housing authorities is **185**

**Condensed Dataset**

* Available as a [CSV](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-fjx3z7PpML94CtsZo5KRmYQLxwYPaAv)

### **Calculated Outputs**

In calculating these outputs, the following example costs were used:

* Per unit cost: $30  
* Per HCV unit cost: $20  
* Flat cost: $3000

#### 	**Costs**

#### 	**Prices**

#### 	**SAM**

* With the example costs and a margin of 30%, the SAM is $53,026,944

#### **Median Price Calculation**

*  The **median required price** based on the median number of HCV units and public housing units is:  
  * With 10% margin: $11,211.11  
  * With 20% margin: $12,612.5  
  * With 30% margin: $14,414.29  
  * With 40% margin: $16,816.67

### **Completion Criteria**

* Correctness of the formulas and calculations.  
* Clarity and accuracy of the visualizations.  
* Proper documentation and explanation of code/formulas and methodology.
